"MatchZoo is a toolkit for text matching. It was developed with a focus on"
" facilitating the designing, comparing and sharing of deep text matching "
"models. There are a number of deep matching methods, such as DRMM, "
"MatchPyramid, MV-LSTM, aNMM, DUET, ARC-I, ARC-II, DSSM, and CDSSM, "
"designed with a unified interface. Potential tasks related to MatchZoo "
"include document retrieval, question answering, conversational response "
"ranking, paraphrase identification, etc. We are always happy to receive "
"any code contributions, suggestions, comments from all our MatchZoo "
"users."
